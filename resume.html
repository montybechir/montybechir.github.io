            </div>
            Used Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to interact with Vimeo API and create a web application that helps local
            talented athletes, that would otherwise be undiscovered, gain exposure and make the recruiting process easier
            for coaches. The web app contains game films and highlights of athletes and uses a purchased template for the
            front end. First iteration is available at finessezone.com

            Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as front-end web development tools to generate dynamic web pages
